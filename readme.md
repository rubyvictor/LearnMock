### STUBS, MOCKS and SPIES
-  **Stubs** enable us to replace functions i.e. return whatever we want
-  **Spies** create fake functions which can be used to track executions such as the number of times it is called
-  **Mocks** are fake methods.  Pre-programmed behaviour and pre-programmed expectations.
